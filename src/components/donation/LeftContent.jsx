        Childhood is said to be the best part of human life – an age where we
        are carefree, safe and happy. But a happy childhood is not the reality
        for many children, who are out-of-school. There are many reasons for
        children to drop out of school – from challenging socio-economic
        circumstances, to lack of awareness in communities where education is
        not seen as a priority.

        Going to school not only ensures a dignified future and a happy present
        for children, but also gives them a safe space to express themselves,
        learn, share and grow. Children who drop out often have to work as child
        labour, are pushed into child marriages, or become victims of child
        trafficking.
